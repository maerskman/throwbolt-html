/*
 * Programming Quiz: Even or Odd (3-2)
 *
 * Write an if...else statement that prints `even` if the 
 * number is even and prints `odd` if the number is odd.
 *
 * Note - make sure to print only the string "even" or the string "odd"
 */

// change the value of `number` to test your if...else statement









var number = 2;

if (/* your conditional goes here */) {
    
} else {

}

-----------------------------------------------------

var number = 2;

if (/* your conditional goes here */) {
    
} else {

}

-------------------------------------------------------


var number = 2;

if (value%2 === 0) {
    console.log ('true');
} else { console.log ('false');

}


--------------------------------------------------



Directions:
Write an if...else statement that:

prints "even" if the number is an even number
prints "odd" if the number is an odd number
Hint: Use the % (modulo) operator to determine if a number is even or odd. The modulo operater takes two numbers and returns the remainder when the first number is divided by the second one:

console.log(12 % 3);
console.log(10 % 4);
Result: 
0 
2

The answer for 12 % 3 is 0 because twelve divided by three has no remainder. 10 % 4 is 2 because ten divided by 4 has a remainder of two.
Make sure to test your code with different values. For example:

If number equals 1, then odd should be printed to the console.
If number equals 12, then even should be printed to the console.
Your Code:





var number = console.log(3%2);
if (number===1) { console.log("even");
} else { console.log("odd");
}



var number ==='3'%'2';
if (number===0) { console.log("even");
} else { console.log("odd");
}



What Went Well
- Your code should have a variable number
- Your code should include an if...else statement
- Your conditional should include a comparison
- Your conditional should use a strict comparison (=== or !==)
What Went Wrong
- Remember to use the modulo operator to determine if number is even or odd
- Verify that your if...else statement is producing the correct output (REMEMBER: Test your code with different values)
Feedback
Not everything is correct yet, but you're close!






var number = 3%2;
if (number==1) { document.write("odd");
} else { console.log("even");
}


var number = 3%2;
if (number==1) { console.log("odd")
} else { console.log("even");
}
